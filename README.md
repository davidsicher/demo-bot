We've prepared this document to serve as a short walkthrough that will have you
up and running by the end of it. In order to create a chatbot we'll be depending
on a few pieces of existing technology. This will allow us to build our bot
with greatly improved speed and ease collaboration efforts so that everyone can
get involved. All of our work will utilize Node.js, so let's start there.

### Step 1: *Install Node.js*

If you do not yet have Node.js installed on your computer please do so by
visiting their [website](http://nodejs.org). This will a Javascript runtime
so that we can execute our code.

### Step 2: *Download this starter kit*

In order to help speed things up we've prepared this demo bot. Inside there are
examples of many of the pieces of functionality you can find in your bot.
Our demo bot is build on top of [Botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit),
